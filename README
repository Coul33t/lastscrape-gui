Instructions:

1. Install PyQt4
2. Run gui.py
3. Report how it went


Package contents:

gui.py - the GUI script
lastscrape.ui - the UI definition
gobble.py - a slightly edited* libre.fm gobbling script
lastscrape.py - an edited* version of the LastScrape script
BeautifulSoup 3.0.7a - just in case: the latest stable version does't work (see http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/3.1-problems.html)
import.py - the CLI script, the GUI doesn't use this.

setup.py - A setup script. You probably don't want to install a one-shot script like this, but it's used in making the package
windist.py - Batchfile to make the Windows package. Uses py2exe and 7zip.
Makefile - Used for making the tarball.
__init__.py - Empty file that makes this a Python package.
You should also receive get copy of the GNU General Public License from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

index.html - The homepage
scsh.png - A screenshot


Notes:

- The GUI version is slower than the command-line script when reading a file that was already downloaded. This is because of the cute editable table.
- It's also slower when scraping, because I changed the time between page scrapes to one second (from 0.5s), as suggested here:
   http://www.last.fm/group/FREE+IS+FREE/forum/119932/_/517695/1#f8994378
* I needed an extra parameter for the long-running functions: a callback to use instead of time.wait, so the GUI thread wouldn't be blocked.
   While I was at it, I also made lastscrape.py a bit more robust.


Changelog:

0.0.5 - Work around some invalid markup on last.fm
0.0.4 - Make lastscrape.py more robust (by returning list instead of yielding tracks)
0.0.3 - Windows packaging fix (uses python 2.5)
0.0.2 - Windows package
0.0.1 - Initial release
